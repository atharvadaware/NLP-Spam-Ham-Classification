# Spam vs. Ham Classification using Word2Vec and AvgWord2Vec

This project demonstrates text classification on a **spam vs. ham dataset** using Word2Vec embeddings and Average Word2Vec representations.  
The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify SMS/email messages as **spam** (unwanted) or **ham** (legitimate).
